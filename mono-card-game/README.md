A server-side script that adds some basic mechanics for [Mono card game](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46777) (which is a not-so-well-made Morrowind-themed ripoff of [UNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game))).


# Installation
Put this in ˇserver/scripts/customˇ and edit your customScripts.lua to contain the following line:
```
require("custom/testMonoGame")
```
